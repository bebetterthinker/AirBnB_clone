## Description

The console is the first segment of the `AirBnB project` at `Holberton School` that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of `AirBnB project` is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the `AirBnB Website(HBnB)`. A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the `AirBnB(HBnB) website.`

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

A command interpreter to manage our Airbnb clone objects:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
